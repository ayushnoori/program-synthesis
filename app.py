st.markdown('''
Here, we implement the non-ML subset of BUSTLE, the algorithm proposed by [Odena *et al.* (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14381). That is, we implement bottom-up enumerative search for simple compound expressions, excluding conditionals, recursion, and loops. The implementation is generic and flexibly supports multiple target languages. Arithmetic and string manipulations are natively supported, defined in `arithmetic.py` and `string.py`, respectively.

st.markdown('''
The most important data structure in this implementation is the abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST is a tree representation of a program, where each node is either a primitive or a compound expression. The AST is represented by the `OperatorNode` class in `abstract_syntax_tree.py`. My AST implementation includes functions to recursively evaluate the operator and its operands and also to generate a string representation of the program.

At program evaluation time, the AST is evaluated from the bottom up. That is, the operands are evaluated first, and then the operator is evaluated on the operands. This is implemented in the `evaluate` method of the `OperatorNode` class. In the case of integers, variable inputs are represented by the `IntegerVariable` class in `arithmetic.py`. When input is not `None`, input type checking and validation is performed by the `evaluate` function in this class.

The pseudocode for the bottom-up synthesis algorithm is reproduced below from [Odena *et al.* (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14381):
